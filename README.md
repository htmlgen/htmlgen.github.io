# The story behind HTMLGen
I've always been frustrated by the lack of good visual HTML designers/code generators. Even now in the year 2016 doing a Google search for something like "<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=html+generator">html generator</a>" or "<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=visual+html+designer">visual html designer</a>" provides little to no relevant results. You get results like table generators or  button generators or link generators or meta tag generators or WYSIWYG textboxes or sites like <a href="http://codepen.io/">codepen.io</a> that would still have you <em>hand-write</em> all your HTML, CSS, and Javascript. That doesn't save me time! The act of hand-coding is what takes so damn long. Give me a tool that actually saves me time and <b>WRITES MY CODE FOR ME</b> while simultaneously supporting all the latest web technologies! I want <em>fast</em>. I want <em>easy</em>. I want <em>simple</em>.

In the same way <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic">Visual Basic</a> revolutionized computer programming for the masses and <a href="http://www.videoscribe.co/">Video Scribe</a> revolutionized presentation making for the masses there needs to be a similar tool made that can <em>revolutionize web design for the masses</em>. A product that allows you to go from idea to reality in minutes. That's what this tool attempts to do.

You might say "Just use Wordpress dummy!" Yes. I know about Wordpress. <a href="https://wordpress.com/">Wordpress</a> is great and allows you to get your content onto the internet fast and is a great <em>publishing</em> platform but is a not so great <em>design</em> platform. Photoshop is great at design but sucks at publishing. What I'm looking for is a tool that allows me to visually create my site and lay things out on the page just the way I want then just spits out HTML and CSS. That's it!

I'm no Vincent van Gogh here. I can't be expected to turn a blank canvas into a beautiful work of art in like 10 seconds. Most people are not skilled artists. Even if you have Photoshop doesn't mean you're skilled at using it. When it comes to web design modern web design tools should have thousands and thousands of pre-made templates to choose from so that normal people can design websites without having to draw it from scratch themselves every time.

<a href="http://www.artisteer.com/">Artisteer</a> is a step in the right direction but I don't like the $50 price tag. I think there should be a free and open-source alternative similar to what <a href="https://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a> is to <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html">Photoshop</a>. Plus I need much finer control over the HTML and CSS. <a href="http://macaw.co/">Macaw</a> has potential but I don't like the fact that you can't see your code and the design side-by-side at the same time and it runs <b>slow as molasses</b> on old computers. For pete's sake we're just making plain text .HTML and .CSS files here we shouldn't need a super computer!

Wikipedia has a nice <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTML_editors">ongoing list of HTML editors here</a> but the fact of the matter is I don't want to spend all day coding. Give me pre-made layouts. Give me pre-made backgrounds. Give me pre-made design elements. Give me pre-made fonts. Give me fancy pre-made controls like tabs and listviews. Allow me to customize every aspect of the page. Don't just have me hand-code everything. For pete's sake that's like living in 1994!

I want a tool that will create an entire HTML document for me top to bottom <em>VISUALLY</em>. And it should support everything HTML supports. And it should support the latest versions of HTML 5 and CSS 3. And it should be able to add modern web technologies like <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts">Google Fonts</a> and <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> and allow you to easily add fancy effects and animations. I want a tool that's kind of like hand coding but <b><em>empowered</em></b> hand coding or <em><b>accelerated</b></em> hand coding. Something that gets the job done <em>FAST!</em>

I really dislike web design programs that treat the end user like an idiot. I'm not an idiot. I could hand-code all my sites from scratch if I wanted to but I just don't want to because it takes too long. Time is our most limited asset here. I believe anything that can be automated should be automated. The user should only be responsible for typing whatever unique content appears on their page not hundreds of opening and closing HTML tags. That's just wasted time.

Think about the evolution of computer programming. If we were to take a time machine back to the 1990's the most popular programming language of the time was C++. If you wanted to write a computer program you just had to hand-code thousands and thousands of lines of C++ and there's nothing that could be done about it. <b><em>The code wouldn't write itself</em></b>. That means that only exquisitely smart computer programmers could write the programs and normal users (aka 99% of the world) could only use the programs and not change them in any way or make their own. (This is analogous to modern-day HTML.)

Then along comes Microsoft and gives the world this program called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic">Visual Basic</a>. They're like "Yeah guys this is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_application_development">Rapid Application Development</a> tool. You can now write any program you want in about 5 minutes. Just by pointing and clicking and dragging and dropping. It's so stupidly simple that even a 5-year-old could do it."

Wow. What a game changer. What an absolute game changer. It's no wonder Microsoft sold millions and millions of copies of Visual Basic back in the day. People like simple. People want simple. All Microsoft did was wrap a GUI around this already existing programming language called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC">BASIC</a> <b>which they didn't even invent</b>. And people came in droves to come buy it from them. People love having the ability to go from idea to reality in minutes. Visual Basic allowed people to do that with computer programs, why doesn't somebody do that with HTML?

I don't want a tool that just applies effects to text. Oh boy. I can make a word bold or underlined. I want a tool that can make the entire SITE LAYOUT for me and make it editable. Allowing me to change every single aspect of the design, the background color, the font, the spacing, control what elements appear where, that sort of thing.

I don't want a <em>table generator</em>, I want a <b>page generator</b>. I want to be able to edit every aspect of the page top to bottom. 

I've always dreamed of a tool that would allow me to visually build a site in just minutes instead of hand-coding all the HTML which takes hours. I've always wanted a program that has the same look and feel as Visual Basic but instead of making desktop applications it makes HTML  and it allows you to do all of your building, editing, and coding all in your browser all for free.

You would think in the year 2016 there would be hundreds of tools out there like this but there's not. Technically the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">Javascript</a> language has the ability to edit and re-position any element on the page at any time using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model">DOM</a>. It's just a matter of us human beings writing the code telling the browser what to do and when to do it. That's what takes so long.

So I've decided to throw my own hat in the ring and make my own HTML generator for the time being which I'm calling HTMLGen. It's only a code name for now and I'm open to suggestions for a better name.

This tool is by no means complete. The amount of features that could be added to a web-based web design tool are just astronomical and if it's only me, one single human being doing all the coding and all the design it's going to take a while. I anticipate to be working on this tool for the next couple of years at least. But I just wanted to throw it out there anyway now in it's current form just to let people play around with it and get feedback.

At this point in the game I am most looking for financial assistance. You must understand creating a tool like this takes an incredible amount of time and I'm still a human being. Still gotta eat. Still gotta sleep. Still gotta pay for a roof over my head. Sending donations by either <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=%65%6C%65%61%64%6F%6E%34%40%67%6D%61%69%6C%2E%63%6F%6D&no_note=0&currency_code=USD">PayPal</a> or <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/eleadon">Bitcoin</a> would be greatly appreicated. Considering the amount of time I'm pouring into this project and the countless hours it could save you and your future web development needs it probably wouldn't kill you to toss me like 5 bucks. If enough people donated I could afford to work on this project full time.

One final note. Yes I am aware there are high-quality, high-grade professional web-design tools out there like <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/muse.html">Adobe Muse</a> and <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/dreamweaver.html">Adobe Dreamweaver</a> but both of which cost money and I'm trying to make a free alternative here that is open-source and community driven. You may consider this project analogous to <a href="http://brackets.io/">Brackets</a> in that it's free and it's only job in life is to produce HTML. The only difference is this tool attempts to visually design the page in the browser and it tries to write out as much of your HTML code for you as it possibly can.
